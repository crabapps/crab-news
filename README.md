# Crab News

Crab News is a multi-platform RSS client for desktop and mobile written in Rust.

## State of the Art

This is my first attempt at a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) application. 
I love to code to internalize a programming language concepts with practice.

### Is it stable?

One day it could be a fully fledged app. In the meantime keep relying on your favorite client.

## Why an RSS reader?

[Awesome Rust](https://awesome-rust.com) doesn't have a RSS reader
listed. I would love to contribute one that I'd use every day. Also,
sounds like a great project to both make and learn a lot from.
