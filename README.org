This is my first attempt at a [[https://rust-lang.org/][Rust]]
application. I love to code to internalize a programming language
concepts with practice.

*** Is it stable?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: is-it-stable
:END:
One day it could be a fully fledged app. In the meantime keep relying on
your favorite client.

** Why an RSS reader?

:END:
[[https://awesome-rust.com][Awesome Rust]] doesn't have a RSS reader
listed. I would love to contribute one that I'd use every day. Also,
sounds like a great project to both make and learn a lot from.
